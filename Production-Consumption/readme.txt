To see how the plot works, first look at the data .xlsx (Produksi-konsumsi)

1. Import data according to the row and column to be selected
2. Conversion of paddy into rice where 10 kg of paddy= 6,274 kg of rice, so we can see rice production and rice consumption (BKP,2014)
3. Calculate Production - Consumption to get surplus or deficits each month
4. Sum the deficits and surpluses of each month to get estimates for the next few months
5. plot all data by district / city
